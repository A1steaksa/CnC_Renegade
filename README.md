# Command & Conquer Renegade

This is a fork of the original C&C Renegade source code released by EA in February of 2025.  
The contents of this repo are modified from that original source to clarify the core logic so it's easier to work with in the [Garry's Mod Renegade](https://github.com/A1steaksa/renegade-hud) project which ports the original C++ to Lua.

The following header has been removed from many of the files, but should still be considered valid:
